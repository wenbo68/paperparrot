Real nightmare as a website developer

I have been developing different types of websites for small businesses, individuals, agencies, startups and
many more for more than one year now. In the course of time, I’ve learned more than just developing/coding
websites - I learned about UI/UX design, multiple AI tools, different development frameworks and most
importantly, dealing with different types of clients.
Following is the list of challenges that I face, and how I try to solve them.
1. The client doesn’t know what they want, but instantly knows when it’s wrong.
2. They send reference websites and say “something like this” or “exactly like this”, without explaining what
they like about any of them.
3. Important assets arrive late, half-finished, low-resolution or as screenshots.
4. Mobile design is ignored during planning, but blamed after launch.
5. Days of silence followed by idea-bombing.
6. Post-launch support is assumed to be unlimited, eternal and free.
You’re hired as a website developer but you slowly have to become, UI/UX designer, logo designer, graphic
designer, brand strategist, content writer and what not XD.
Not everything is avoidable but here’s how I deal with things after one yoe;
I have a set of around 15-20 questions about design, feel, and UX for the website. This ensures that the
client pours out every single idea related to the website.
I ask for a “brand identity” or try to understand their business.
I try to make mockup designs before starting to code, because it saves time and energy. AI tools have
made things simpler now.
I help the client figure out the best practices, because most clients are unaware of real technical details,
they only know words like “SEO” or “Landing page”
I help my clients figure out what best suits their interests and needs.
I centralize communication, and put everything in writing, so that changes could be tracked, people
usually forget what they agreed to.
I propose best plans for website maintenance after launch (E-com or sophisticated websites need regular
security checks and maintenance)
What I have learned the hard way:
1. Bad clients exist, but unclear systems attract them faster.
2. Strong processes don’t scare good clients away, they filter bad ones out.
I still have a lot to learn, and I am learning everyday. Sometimes clients even say that my services are
overpriced, but let me tell you one thing, you’re not paying for the website, you’re paying for the accountability,
for the decisions, the experience, and the problems you don’t have to deal with later. I’m not selling code, I’m
selling responsibility.
